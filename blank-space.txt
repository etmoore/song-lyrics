Nice to meet you, where you been?
I can show you incredible things.
Magic, madness, heaven sin,
So I saw you standing there

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames.
You can tell me when it's over
if it was worth the pain.

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

I donâ€™t know this song.
But it probably goes
la la la la la
right here.

Teri's changes
